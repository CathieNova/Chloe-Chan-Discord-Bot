## 👋 Welcome
The public version is always stable and has been tested properly.
Now that being said, i'm not without flaws, so something unexpected could occur.

This bot does contain some Premium features, but you are not required to get them, it only advertises my own discord.
If you wish to remove that then join my discord and look at the #Haven-Access channel.

I do accept feedback and suggestions on the bot. Just use **/suggest** or **/feedback** command and i will see it.
> *`This discord bot is being worked on daily to improve the quality as well as upcoming features.`*
