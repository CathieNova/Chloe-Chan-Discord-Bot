# ðŸ“ƒ Chloe-Chan Roadmap
The way this Roadmap works is that each bulletpoint is a feature, and each blue marker inside them is a feature inside that feature.

Once all blue markers have been implemented, it will be moved to the public branch.

## ðŸ“† Planned Features
- `Add modal for suggestion command`
    > A popup message where you can use dropdowns and such instead of adding everything in the command.
- `Add a config for each guild.`
    > Add a changelog command only i can use so it gives out notifications to channels that has setup the bot.

    > Add several modules you can turn on or off using commands.

    > Add a setup command so it creates various things for the guild.
- `Add a way to ban a server from using the bot.`
    > This will only be used if someone abuses or violates my "Use Common sense" rule.
- `Add a command to make a private voice channel for @ people.`
    > Basically create a command that will allow you do create a voice channel only for the person using the command as well as other users mentioned in the command, once they all leave voice, it will remove that voice channel.
- `Add a feedback command using Modal.`
    > It will be similar to the Suggestion command, but have more information and details.
- `Add a counter for number of bots, online and total members.`
    > A basic channel that keeps track of humans in the discord server. (alternatively can add a command for it)
    
    > Example: `Members: 5836`
